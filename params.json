{"name":"QuickBox","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to QuickBox project.\r\nThis project is mainly QtDeclarative platform for QWidgets. This is different approach that Digia has. They are creatings QWidgets using Quick2, it is so called QuickControls. I'm bringing QWidgets to the declarative environment, so one can use old good QWidgets in QML. To expose QWidget based controls to QML, they have to be lightly overridden and registered to declarative framework in QML plugin. There are two such a plugins currently implemented: \r\n\r\n* qfcoreplugin - core QML objects (SQL, cryptography, networking, etc. )\r\n* qfqmlwidgetsplugin - GUI stuff, QWidget based controls, framework classes (MainWindow, PluginLoader, etc. )\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
